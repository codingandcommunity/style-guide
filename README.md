# style-guide
This repository contains the style guide for coding and community. It should contain all graphic design/brand assets as wells as hex codes for colors and recommended fonts.

# What is a style guide? #

Don't worry. This document is simpler than it seems. You're probably only here to copy and paste one picture or value. You've got this.

When I ran a google search for "what is a style guide," I got the following quote from https://www.executionists.com/website-brand-style-guide/:

> A brand style guide is the primary visual DNA of your company’s branding, though it can also reference grammar, tone, word usage and point of view. Essentially, it’s a document that describes, defines and presents examples of what your brand looks like in various visual media such as print, Internet and broadcast. To be effective it must clearly define the rules around your online presence in all channels such as websites, landing pages, mobile sites, online ads, blogs, social media channels and email communications (including email signatures!).

So, this document contains links to official versions of the coding&&community, names of coding&&community fonts, and hex codes of coding&&community colors.

# Why? Isn't this a lot of effort? #

Well. It all started when I realized we were using at least four different shades of blue to represent our brand. This had to stop. A consistent brand is key to a professional organization.

This style guide will help ensure that we always represent the coding&&community brand in a consistent way.

# Name #

For the purpose of branded material, the name of this organization is `coding&&community` and is styled as such. All letters are lowercase, and two ampersand (`&`) characters are used to separate the word `coding` from the word `community`.

### Exceptions ###

- If entering the name `coding&&community` into a form that does not accept the ampersand (`&`) character, then the name of this organization should be styled as follows: `codingandcommunity`. The two ampersands are replaced with the word `and`, and all letters remain lowercase. For example, our GitHub profile is located at https://github.com/codingandcommunity.

# Logo #

The coding&&community logo consists of a blue rounded rectangle containing the text `{coding&&community}` in white text using the `Avenir` font.

![font window](readme/logo-font.png)

The logo is quite wide and should be placed at the top of documents and websites. It should also be used for stickers. It should not be used if the logo must be a square or if width is a major concern. The icon should be used in these cases.

It is recommended to use the SVG version wherever possible. This allows for infinite scaling without resolution issues. If a pixel image format is required, PNG should be used for the clearest image, and JPG should be used if image size is the dominant concern. The smallest image size that avoids pixelation/resolution issues should be used.
